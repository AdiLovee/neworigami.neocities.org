      <p>NewOrigami is the spiritual successor to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317080729/http://www.origami.org/index.html">Origami.com</a>, formerly by Alex Barber.</p>
      <p>This is an archive dedicated to preserving and sharing as many publicly-available origami diagrams as possible, with a heavy focus on diagrams shared on sites that no longer existor only exist in the Wayback Machine now.</p>
      <p>In the future I would like to turn this into a giant hub of free diagrams contributed by the community, so please feel free to share any diagrams you'd like with me!</p>
      <p>All diagrams are presented in PDF format.</p>
      <p>This site is regularly being updated, so please follow the <a href="https://neocities.org/site/neworigami">site</a> and leave feedback and comments in the <a href="https://neworigami.atabook.org">guestbook</a>.</p>
      <p>Have a diagram you'd like to be shared here? Just upload it to any file transfer site and comment the link!<br>Have a creator you'd like to share? Comment their site and/or YouTube Channel and I'll also add it!</p>
