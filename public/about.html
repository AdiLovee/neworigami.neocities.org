      <p>NewOrigami is the spiritual successor to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130317080729/http://www.origami.org/index.html">Origami.com</a>, formerly by Alex Barber.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is an archive dedicated to preserving and sharing as many publicly-available origami diagrams as possible, with a heavy focus on diagrams shared on sites that no longer existor only exist in the Wayback Machine now.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the future I would like to turn this into a giant hub of free diagrams contributed by the community, so please feel free to share any diagrams you'd like with me!</p>
      <br>
      <p>All diagrams are presented in PDF format.</p>
      <br>
